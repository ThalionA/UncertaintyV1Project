# PROJECT_LOG — single source of truth for cross-session tracking

**Start here on every new session.** This is the hub: an index of the living
documents, a rolled-up list of active open threads, and a reverse-chronological
session log. Detailed per-session handoffs live in their own files and are
linked from each entry (not duplicated).

**End of session ritual:** add a dated entry at the **top** of the Session log
below (newest first) — 3–6 lines + open items, linking any detailed handoff you
wrote. Fold persistent pitfalls into `GOTCHAS.md`, durable facts into
`memory/`. Keep this file the entry point.

## Active open threads (rolled up — prune as done)

**Live plan: [`nn_decoder/PLAN_2026-06-03_mate_followups.md`](nn_decoder/PLAN_2026-06-03_mate_followups.md)**
— the authoritative, prioritised roadmap after the 2026-06-03 Máté meeting
(supersedes the "next steps" tails of the recent handoffs). Top of it:

- **Tier A — DONE (2026-06-03).** A1 (`plot_weight_evolution_cell.py` figs D/E/F +
  best-val ★) and A2 (`posterior_pca_views.py`) built + run on `loss_comparison_v1`;
  meeting items 2–6 closed. Basis decision resolved → both (decoded + IO target).
- **Tier B (cluster, batch together)** — B1: hidden-width ablation `H∈{4,8,16,32,64}`
  — runner is **turnkey** (`run_loss_comparison.py --hidden-sizes ...`); still need
  to run it + write `plot_overfit_vs_width.py`. B2: PPC `weight_decay` sweep (PPC
  alone may want 1e-3/1e-2). *Open decision:* H ladder span (go ≤2 to force underfitting?).
- **Tier C (deferred)** — trained-as-target round-trip; stratified PCA basis;
  refill Wasserstein/JS gaps in `loss_sweep_h10_val_2026_05_27`; `pca_loss_demo`
  vs `diagnostics/loss_smoothness_demo` consolidation.

Other standing threads:
- **Finish the `loss_comparison_v1` cluster grid** (L cells beyond `full_50ms`,
  all OOD splits), rsync down, re-run `nn_decoder/plot_all_cells.py`. Resumable.
  [2026-06-03]
- **Decide the production loss**: cross-loss evidence favours CE/KL (calibrated
  generalists) over PCA (at chance under KL/CE); PCA is the historical basis and
  the stim_mean framing depends on it. Tie to headline framing. [2026-06-03]
- **Headline framing decision** (with Máté): (a) PPC-vs-SBC architectural — not
  recommended; (b) feature-ablation — narrower TV>order claim; (c) Similarity
  Framework. See 2026-05-16. [open]
- **Task 2 done; Task 5 next**: residual-PCA retraining, if the residual
  partial-correlation result warrants (`documents/residual_partial_correlation.md`).
- **GPR + LOMO feature-ablation** run locally. [2026-05-16]
- **Methods-PDF rewrites** deferred until framing locked
  (`documents/methods_updates_required.md`).
- **n=6 ceiling**: group spat/temp test bottlenecked by between-mouse
  inconsistency, not trial count. [noted]

## Session log (newest first)

### 2026-06-03 — Tier A executed (weight + posterior-PCA diagnostics)
Ran the whole of Tier A from the live plan, all on existing `loss_comparison_v1`
data (no cluster). Data audit first: the checkpoints carry full weight tensors at
init (epoch 0) + every 10 epochs, plus train/val curves and decoded+target
posteriors — so meeting items 2–6 needed no re-run.
- **A1** — extended `plot_weight_evolution_cell.py` with figs D (fan-in-normalised
  `‖W_in‖/√N_in`, `‖W_out‖/√H`), E (weight mean±std vs snapshot epoch + init ref),
  F (init-vs-final histograms, **all 4 param groups** W_in/b_in/W_out/b_out per a
  follow-up Máté ask), and a best-val ★ on fig A. Ran both archs × 6 mice.
  Also answered Máté: **softmax temperature is not a free parameter** —
  `forward` returns raw logits, `F.softmax` has fixed T=1; sharpness is set only
  by the `W_out`/`b_out` logit scale (biases init to exactly 0). See memory
  `loss-comparison-v1-checkpoints`.
- **A2** — new `posterior_pca_views.py`: PC1/PC2 scatter (decoded + IO-target
  overlay), `mean + a·σ·PC` reconstruction strips, all-losses shared-target-basis
  panel. Ran all losses/archs/bases.
- **Findings:** weight **mean stays ≈0**; norm growth is **pure std broadening**;
  init is standard **Xavier-uniform** (not weird) — meeting item 5 closed.
  Target-basis **PC1≈91% var = peak position, PC2 = width**; the decoded-PCA basis
  is spiky; PCA is visibly more dispersed in latent space than CE/KL/JS/Wass.
- **B1 made turnkey:** added `--hidden-sizes` to `run_loss_comparison.py` (isolates
  each width under `run_name_h<H>`); 35/35 relevant tests pass (config/early/pca).
- Vault synced (ticked items 2–6 in `UncertaintyV1-Tasks`, logged). Figures under
  `figures/loss_sweep_plots/loss_comparison_v1/weight_evolution/` and
  `figures/posterior_pca/loss_comparison_v1/` (both gitignored).
- **Open / next:** Tier B on the cluster — run the hidden-width ablation + PPC
  `weight_decay` sweep, then write a small `plot_overfit_vs_width.py`. Open
  decision: H-ladder span (go ≤2 to force underfitting?). Tier C unchanged.

### 2026-06-03 — Máté meeting → revised plan
Meeting follow-ups routed into a prioritised roadmap: Tier A (local — weight-norm
diagnostic refit, posterior PCA views), Tier B (cluster — hidden-width ablation,
PPC weight_decay sweep), Tier C (deferred). This is the current "what next".
→ live plan: `nn_decoder/PLAN_2026-06-03_mate_followups.md`

### 2026-06-03 — All-loss spat/temp comparison & cross-loss test-time eval
Compared **all five losses** (PCA, CE, KL, JS, Wasserstein; MSE dropped) for
PPC vs SBC. Extended `run_loss_comparison.py` to all losses (matched,
early-stopped, Q+L × {50,100}ms × {full,half} × 3 splits = 40 slugs); built the
`plot_all_cells.py` capstone + five per-cell drivers (`cross_loss_eval.py`
skill matrices + paired stats, `within_mouse_loss_plots.py`,
`loss_scatter_spat_temp.py`, `plot_loss_spat_temp_comparison.py`, temporal
posterior evolution in `plot_loss_sweep.py`). **Findings:** PCA loss is at
chance under KL/CE (scale-free, via shuffle-normalised skill); CE/KL are
calibrated generalists; SBC>PPC is real but small and metric-shaped (group-sig
only for raw loss under PCA/CE/KL), limited by between-mouse inconsistency
(3/6 mice carry it). Open: finish grid; pick production loss.

### 2026-06-03 — PCA-loss demo + weight-evolution diagnostic + talk plan
Pedagogical "what the PCA loss sees" suite (`nn_decoder/pca_loss_demo.py`) and
output-weight-norm trajectories per cell (`nn_decoder/plot_weight_evolution_cell.py`),
both on `loss_comparison_v1`. New empirical result from weight trajectories
**complicates the weight-magnitude hypothesis** and **inverts
entropy-reg-as-weight-reg**. Serves the 2026-05-27 meeting threads (PPC
peakiness; honest spat-vs-temp).
→ full: `nn_decoder/HANDOFF_loss_demo_weight_evolution.md`

### 2026-06-02 — KL/JS entropy-λ sweep plotting
Built the KL/JS sweep plotting (`plot_kl_js_sweep.py`, `plot_kl_js_training.py`):
peakiness, knob sweeps, matched example posteriors, per-bin posteriors, held-out
fit-loss; spat|temp side by side. Identified that training-curve/weight plots
need a history-tracked re-run. Motivated the matched, full-export
`run_loss_comparison.py` (→ became the 06-03 grid).
→ full: `nn_decoder/HANDOFF_kl_js_plots.md`

### 2026-05-17 — weight_decay fix + residual-PCA basis + weight saving + loadings
Fixed the hardcoded `weight_decay=3e-4` bug; added `pca_basis ∈
{condition_mean, residual}`; trained-weight saving in `run_animal_decoder`;
`decoder_loadings_comparison.py` scaffold; spatial-vs-temporal performance plot
across targets; runner extension for L/d (+ a builtin-shadowing bug).
→ full: `NOTES.md` § "Session 2026-05-17"

### 2026-05-16 — Mate's-question feature ablation + framing audit
Implemented `feature_ablation_analysis.py` (CV regression, rate vs
temporal-variance vs order-sensitive blocks, cluster-robust paired stats,
Musall-style plots). Honest result: temporal-variance > order-sensitive is
robust; rate vs temporal-variance does not reach significance at n=6. Deep
audit concluding the PPC/SBC architectural framing is loose and the PCA loss is
structurally biased toward stim_mean.

### 2026-05-06 — Decomposition + IO coherence + stim-mean baseline + loss sweep
Decomposition analysis, IO coherence, stim_mean baseline, first loss sweep;
headline numbers recorded for the meeting.
